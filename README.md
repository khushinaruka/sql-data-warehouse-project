# üìä SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

welcome to the data warehouse and analytics project
This project demonstrates a complete **data warehousing and analytics solution**, covering the process from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights.  

**Key Features:**  
- Data modeling and warehouse design  
- SQL queries for data transformation and analysis  
- Best practices in data management and reporting  
- End-to-end workflow for analytics  

This project is designed as a **portfolio project** to highlight skills in **SQL, data engineering, and business analytics**.  

## üìå Project Requirements  

### 1. Data Warehouse Development (Data Engineering)  

**Objective:**  
Build a scalable and modern data warehouse using SQL Server that consolidates sales-related information into a single repository. This warehouse will serve as the foundation for reliable reporting, trend analysis, and business decision-making.  

**Detailed Requirements:**  
- **Data Sources:** Collect raw data from two independent operational systems (ERP and CRM). Both systems will export data in CSV format, which will then be ingested into the warehouse.  
- **Data Quality & Cleansing:** Perform profiling of the source files to identify missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Apply cleansing techniques to standardize and ensure accuracy across datasets.  
- **Integration:** Unify the ERP and CRM datasets into one centralized and business-friendly schema. The resulting data model should be optimized for analytical queries (e.g., star schema or snowflake schema).  
- **Scope & Coverage:** Prioritize loading the most recent transactional data while maintaining the option to include historical records for trend analysis. This ensures flexibility between real-time insights and long-term performance evaluation.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Implement indexing, partitioning, and query optimization strategies to enhance query response times for large datasets.  
- **Documentation & Metadata:** Provide comprehensive documentation that explains table structures, relationships, transformations, and data lineage. This will make the solution easier to maintain for both data engineers and business analysts.

### 2. Business Intelligence, Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)  

**Objective:**  
Use SQL-based reporting and analysis techniques to extract actionable insights from the data warehouse, enabling organizations to make informed, evidence-based decisions.  

**Focus Areas for Analysis:**  
- **Customer Behavior:** Identify purchasing patterns, customer segmentation, and churn risks.  
- **Product Performance:** Track top-performing and underperforming products across regions and time periods.  
- **Sales Trends:** Analyze seasonal sales behavior, growth patterns, and revenue fluctuations.  
- **KPI Dashboards:** Create SQL queries that support dashboards highlighting revenue, average order value, retention rates, and profitability.  

**Expected Outcomes:**  
- Stakeholders will gain **a 360-degree view** of business operations through consistent reporting.  
- Managers and executives can rely on **real-time metrics** to monitor performance.  
- Analysts will have access to **a clean, integrated dataset**, reducing time spent on manual data preparation.  
- The organization will be empowered with **data-driven decision-making**, reducing guesswork and improving strategy execution.  
## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me  

Hi, I‚Äôm khushi naruka üëã  

I‚Äôm currently a student and aspiring Data Analyst , with a strong interest in working with **databases, SQL, and analytics**.  
This is one of my first end-to-end projects where I tried to apply what I‚Äôm learning about **data warehousing, cleaning, and business intelligence**.  

Although I don‚Äôt have professional experience yet, I‚Äôm passionate about:  
- Learning modern data technologies step by step  
- Solving real-world problems using SQL and analytics  
- Building projects that demonstrate practical skills  

I believe projects like this are the best way to learn and showcase progress. I‚Äôm continuously improving my skills and excited to enter the data field. üöÄ  

If you have suggestions or feedback on this project, I‚Äôd love to hear from you!
